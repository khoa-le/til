###Constructing the Object Model

Before the browser can render the page it needs to construct the DOM and CSSOM trees. As a result, we need to ensure that we deliver both the HTML and CSS to the browser as quickly as possible.

Letâ€™s start, with the simplest possible case: a plain HTML page with some text and a single image. What does the browser need to do to process this simple page?

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Critical Path</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
